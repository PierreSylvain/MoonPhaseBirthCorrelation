# Moon Phase and Birth Correlation

## Description

This project aims to analyze and debunk the widely-held belief that lunar phases influence birth rates.
Using a dataset from Statbel combined with the ephem library and statistical analysis, we explore whether
there is a correlation between moon phases and daily birth counts.

## Data

The data used in this project includes:

- The date
- Number of births on that date
- Moon phase on that date
- Moon Emoji

Data Source: [StatBel](https://statbel.fgov.be/sites/default/files/files/opendata/bevolking/Geboorte/TF_BIRTHS.zip)

The moon phases used in this analysis are computed using the `ephem` Python library.

## Methodology

### Data exploration to understand the distribution of births across lunar phases.

| Dernier quartier      | 326.302622 |  
| Gibbeuse croissante   | 327.135288 |

| Pleine lune           | 327.502678 | 
| Premier croissant     | 325.645472 | 
| Premier quartier      | 327.458657 | 

### Hypothesis testing (ANOVA) to determine if birth averages vary significantly across different lunar phases.
 - f-value: 0.13819272173295818
 - p-value: 0.9834565625981031

## Results

We have stated the following assumptions:
$$H_0$$: There is no correlation between moon phases and births.
$$H_1$$: There is a correlation between moon phases and births.

To test these hypotheses, we performed an ANOVA test, which compares the means of several groups.

Results:

F-value: 0.1381
p-value: 0.9834

**The ANOVA test showed no significant difference in birth counts across lunar phases.**

> There's no evidence supporting the belief that lunar phases influence birth rates.

## How to Run the Code
